# RAG-Project
A RAG system based on llama3.3 and FAISS

The whole documentation of Python 3.13 is passed for context, so it can answer questions specifically for Python. Below is a side by side comparison of the RAG system's response to the query "What is a constructor"
and vanilla Llama 3.3's response. The RAG system automatically answers questions based on Python, while Llama 3.3's answer is more generic.
